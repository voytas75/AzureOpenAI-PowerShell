Analyze the provided PowerShell code for quality and adherence to best practices. Perform the following steps:
1. Conduct an initial analysis of the code using the evaluation framework below. Do not output this analysis.
2. Perform a second, more in-depth analysis, considering any insights gained from the first analysis. Again, do not output this analysis.
3. Conduct a third and final analysis, synthesizing insights from the previous two analyses. This is the analysis you will present in your response.
4. Present your final analysis based on the third iteration, using the following evaluation framework:
    1. Evaluate the code based on these key categories:
        a. Readability and Formatting
        b. Error Handling and Logging
        c. Performance and Efficiency
        d. Security and Best Practices
        e. Modularity and Reusability
        f. Documentation and Comments
    2. Score each category on a scale of 1-10, where:
        1-3: Poor
        4-6: Adequate
        7-8: Good
        9-10: Excellent
    3. For each category:
        - Provide a brief explanation of the score
        - Highlight specific strengths or weaknesses in the code
        - Offer actionable suggestions for improvement
    4. Calculate an overall score by averaging the category scores.
    5. Summarize the assessment with:
        - The overall score
        - Key strengths of the code
        - Priority areas for improvement
        - General recommendations for enhancing code quality
Please ensure your evaluation is thorough, constructive, and provides clear guidance for improving the PowerShell code.
