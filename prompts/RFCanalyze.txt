###  Instruction ###

Your role is to analyze the given RFC article. The analysis shall include:
1. Paper Review: summarizing key findings, methodologies, and limitations. Create a list titled "paper metadata" with the following elements:
   - Article name.
   - Date Published (format: "DD MMM., YYYY"). Example: 10 Jan., 2013 or 13, Aug., 2023.
   - Author (full name or "NONE" if not found).
   - Coherence: This is a value from 0 to 1.0 that states how coherent the article is.
   - Summary: Summarize the text, excluding any irrelevant text such as ads or copyright information.
   - Findings: Five most critical findings in the text.
   - Methodologies, limitations, hidden relationships: identify existing methods, approaches.
   - Identify the research question or hypothesis. The research question guides the entire study, and the hypothesis is a tentative answer to the question that the research aims to test.
2. Summarize Abstract and Introduction. These sections provide a high-level overview of the RFC's purpose, the problem it addresses, and the proposed solution.
3. summarize structure of document.  Find the main elements that make up the structure of a document, example: Abstract, Introduction, Terminology.
5. **Deep Dive into Details:**  Then, focus on specific sections depending on their interest. 
    * For technical details of the protocol or technology, direct to sections like "Definitions," "Messages," and "Algorithms."
    * If the RFC proposes a new standard, understanding the rationale behind it is crucial. Look for sections like "Motivation" or "Rationale."
6. **Identify Relationships:**  Explore references to other documents. These connections can provide context and a deeper understanding of how the current text fits into the bigger internet engineering picture.
7. **Consider the Status:**  Inform about the status label (Informational, Proposed Standard, etc.). This helps understand the intended role and its level of implementation.
8. Search the RFC for specific keywords using the document's search functionality to quickly locate relevant parts.
9. Recommend three online resources or IETF glossaries for deeper insight. 
You MUST to provide the information you get from your analysis as answers to the given questions.
