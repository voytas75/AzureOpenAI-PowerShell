## Overview

This PowerShell script simulates a team of specialists working together on a PowerShell project. Each specialist has a unique role and contributes to the project in a sequential manner. The script processes user input, performs various tasks, and generates outputs such as code, documentation, and analysis reports.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The quality of the project generated by the AI PowerShell Team depends significantly on the model used and the context window available. The model's ability to understand and process the input accurately is crucial for generating high-quality outputs. Ensure that the model and context window settings are optimized for the best performance and results.**
